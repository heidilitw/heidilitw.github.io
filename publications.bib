               regarded as a direct indicator for performance comparison among
               different electrodes. Considering that the open-circuit potential
               (OCP) varies from electrode to electrode, the photocurrent
               comparison at a fixed potential may misrepresent the actual
               differences between samples. Here, we study the PEC performance
               by applying two distinct external bias values, one at 0 V vs.
               Ag/AgCl deriving from the conventional practice and the other at

               by depositing a thin layer of SnO2 on the Au surface of Au
               particle-decorated ZnO nanorods. For ZnO-Au-SnO2 nanorods, the

               electron transfer from the conduction band of SnO2 to the valence
               band of ZnO. This vectorial charge transfer resulted in the
               situation that the photoexcited electrons accumulated at ZnO

               ZnO-Au-SnO2 substantially high redox powers. Time-resolved

  abstract  = "The most important factor that complicates the work of
               dysmorphologists is the significant phenotypic variability of the
               human face. Next-Generation Phenotyping (NGP) tools that assist
               clinicians with recognizing characteristic syndromic patterns are
               particularly challenged when confronted with patients from
               populations different from their training data. To that end, we
               systematically analyzed the impact of genetic ancestry on facial
               dysmorphism. For that purpose, we established the GestaltMatcher
               Database (GMDB) as a reference dataset for medical images of
               patients with rare genetic disorders from around the world. We
               collected 10,980 frontal facial images - more than a quarter
               previously unpublished - from 8,346 patients, representing 581
               rare disorders. Although the predominant ancestry is still
               European (67\%), data from underrepresented populations have been
               increased considerably via global collaborations (19\% Asian and
               7\% African). This includes previously unpublished reports for
               more than 40\% of the African patients. The NGP analysis on this
               diverse dataset revealed characteristic performance differences
               depending on the composition of training and test sets
               corresponding to genetic relatedness. For clinical use of NGP,
               incorporating non-European patients resulted in a profound
               enhancement of GestaltMatcher performance. The top-5 accuracy
               rate increased by +11.29\%. Importantly, this improvement in
               delineating the correct disorder from a facial portrait was
               achieved without decreasing the performance on European patients.
               By design, GMDB complies with the FAIR principles by rendering
               the curated medical data findable, accessible, interoperable, and
               reusable. This means GMDB can also serve as data for training and
               benchmarking. In summary, our study on facial dysmorphism on a
               global sample revealed a considerable cross ancestral phenotypic
               variability confounding NGP that should be counteracted by
               international efforts for increasing data diversity. GMDB will
               serve as a vital reference database for clinicians and a
               transparent training set for advancing NGP technology.",
