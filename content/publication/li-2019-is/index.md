abstract: This study reports a delicate electroless approach for the deposition of
  RuO2·nH2O nanoparticles on the VO x ·mH2O nanowires and this method can be extended
  to deposit RuO2·nH2O nanoparticles on various material surfaces. Electrochemical
  characterizations, including linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical quartz
  crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis and rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) voltammetry,
  were carried out to investigate the growth mechanism. The deposition involves the
  catalytic reduction of dissolved oxygen by the V4+ species of VO x ·mH2O, which
  drives the oxidation of RuCl3 to proceed with the growth of RuO2·nH2O. This core/shell
  VO x ·mH2O/RuO2·nH2O shows a better catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction
  (ORR) than RuO2·nH2O, which is ascribed to the pronounced dispersion of RuO2·nH2O.
  Such an electroless approach was applicable to the preparation of a RuO2-based nanoparticle
  suspension as well as the deposition of nanocrystalline RuO2·nH2O on other functional
  supports like TiO2 nanowires. The thus-obtained RuO2-decorated TiO2 nanorods exhibit
  significantly an enhanced photoactivity toward photoelectrochemical water oxidation.
  The versatility of the current electroless approach may facilitate the widespread
  deployment of nanocrystalline RuO2·nH2O in a variety of energy-related applications.
