 abstract = {This study reports a delicate electroless approach for the
deposition of RuO2·nH2O nanoparticles on the VO x ·mH2O nanowires
and this method can be extended to deposit RuO2·nH2O
nanoparticles on various material surfaces. Electrochemical
characterizations, including linear sweep voltammetry (LSV),
electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis and
rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) voltammetry, were carried out
to investigate the growth mechanism. The deposition involves the
catalytic reduction of dissolved oxygen by the V4+ species of VO
x ·mH2O, which drives the oxidation of RuCl3 to proceed with the
growth of RuO2·nH2O. This core/shell VO x ·mH2O/RuO2·nH2O shows a
better catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
than RuO2·nH2O, which is ascribed to the pronounced dispersion of
RuO2·nH2O. Such an electroless approach was applicable to the
preparation of a RuO2-based nanoparticle suspension as well as
the deposition of nanocrystalline RuO2·nH2O on other functional
supports like TiO2 nanowires. The thus-obtained RuO2-decorated
TiO2 nanorods exhibit significantly an enhanced photoactivity
toward photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The versatility of
the current electroless approach may facilitate the widespread
deployment of nanocrystalline RuO2·nH2O in a variety of
energy-related applications.},
