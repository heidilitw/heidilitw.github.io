abstract: Tremendous development in the field of portable electronics and hybrid electric
  vehicles has led to urgent and increasing demand in the field of high-energy storage
  devices. In recent years, many research efforts have been made for the development
  of more efficient energy-storage devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, and
  fuel cells. In particular, supercapacitors have great potential to meet the demands
  of both high energy density and power density in many advanced technologies. For
  the last half decade, graphene has attracted intense research interest for electrical
  double-layer capacitor (EDLC) applications. The unique electronic, thermal, mechanical,
  and chemical characteristics of graphene, along with the intrinsic benefits of a
  carbon material, make it a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
  This Review focuses on recent research developments in graphene-based supercapacitors,
  including doped graphene, activated graphene, graphene/metal oxide composites, graphene/polymer
  composites, and graphene-based asymmetric supercapacitors. The challenges and prospects
  of graphene-based supercapacitors are also discussed.
