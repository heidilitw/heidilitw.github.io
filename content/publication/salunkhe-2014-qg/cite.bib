 abstract = {Tremendous development in the field of portable electronics and
hybrid electric vehicles has led to urgent and increasing demand
in the field of high-energy storage devices. In recent years,
many research efforts have been made for the development of more
efficient energy-storage devices such as supercapacitors,
batteries, and fuel cells. In particular, supercapacitors have
great potential to meet the demands of both high energy density
and power density in many advanced technologies. For the last
half decade, graphene has attracted intense research interest for
electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) applications. The unique
electronic, thermal, mechanical, and chemical characteristics of
graphene, along with the intrinsic benefits of a carbon material,
make it a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
This Review focuses on recent research developments in
graphene-based supercapacitors, including doped graphene,
activated graphene, graphene/metal oxide composites,
graphene/polymer composites, and graphene-based asymmetric
supercapacitors. The challenges and prospects of graphene-based
supercapacitors are also discussed.},
