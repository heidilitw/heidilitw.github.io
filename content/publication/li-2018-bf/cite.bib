 abstract = {A more accurate and reliable method is proposed to evaluate the
photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of semiconductor toward
water splitting. Conventionally, I-t measurements are conducted
at a fixed potential relative to the reference electrode, e.g., 0
V vs. Ag/AgCl, to monitor the photocurrent, which has been
regarded as a direct indicator for performance comparison among
different electrodes. Considering that the open-circuit potential
(OCP) varies from electrode to electrode, the photocurrent
comparison at a fixed potential may misrepresent the actual
differences between samples. Here, we study the PEC performance
by applying two distinct external bias values, one at 0 V vs.
Ag/AgCl deriving from the conventional practice and the other at
0.1 V vs. OCP representing the exactly fixed applied
overpotential. Two experimental groups are designed to address
the arguments, including the influence of heat treatment for ZnO
nanorod arrays and the global comparison among ZnO, TiO2, Au
particle-decorated TiO2, and CdS electrodes. Different trends in
photocurrent are observed at the two distinct biases, with the
results from 0.1 V vs. OCP conforming to the general
considerations. The results suggest that application of a fixed
potential relative to the OCP will provide a more fair comparison
for accurate PEC performance evaluation without under- or
over-estimation.},
