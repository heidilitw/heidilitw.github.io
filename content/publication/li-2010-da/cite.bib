 abstract = {This work demonstrates that anodic deposition of vanadium oxide
(denoted as VOx·nH2O) can be considered as the chemical
co-precipitation of V5+ and V4+ oxy-/hydroxyl species and the
accumulation of V5+ species at the vicinity of electrode surface
is the key factor for the successful anodic deposition of
VOx·nH2O at a potential much more negative than the equilibrium
potential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results of
in situ UV–vis spectra show that the V4+/V5+ ratio near the
electrode surface can be controlled by varying the applied
potential, leading to different, three-dimensional (3D)
nanostructures of VOx·nH2O. The accumulation of V5+ species due
to V4+ oxidation at potentials ≥0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) has been
found to be very similar to the phenomenon by adding H2O2 in the
deposition solution. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS)
results show that all VOx·nH2O deposits can be considered as
aggregates consisting of mixed V5+ and V4+ oxy-/hydroxyl species
with the mean oxidation state significantly increasing with the
applied electrode potential.},
