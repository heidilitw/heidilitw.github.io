 abstract = {We reported for the first time that GaOOH nanorods, which were
prepared using a facile chemical precipitation method, may
display noticeable photocatalytic activities toward methanol
oxidation under light illumination, a significant revelation for
demonstrating their use as the anode photocatalyst in the
half-cell reaction of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The
GaOOH nanorods were further decorated with Au nanoparticles to
endow them with increasingly pronounced charge separation, which
conduced to a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic
performance. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was
employed to depict the charge transfer event across the interface
of GaOOH/Au, from which a correlation between photocatalytic
efficiency and interfacial charge dynamics was realized. By
incorporating GaOOH nanorods into the traditional Pt-catalyzed
half-cell reaction, a 12.7% increase in anodic current
generation can be attained under light illumination,
demonstrating the promising potential of GaOOH as a practical
anode photocatalyst in DFMCs. A further enhancement in methanol
oxidation current up to 70.8% can be achieved by employing
Au-decorated GaOOH nanorods, which was attributed to the
efficient charge carrier transfer rendered by the Au decoration.
The current study delivers both fundamental and practical
importance as it broadens the scope of electrocatalysts for fuel
cells, specifically by introducing a new class of highly
efficient photocatalysts for promoting electrochemical reactions.},
