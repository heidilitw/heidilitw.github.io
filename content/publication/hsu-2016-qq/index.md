abstract: We reported for the first time that GaOOH nanorods, which were prepared
  using a facile chemical precipitation method, may display noticeable photocatalytic
  activities toward methanol oxidation under light illumination, a significant revelation
  for demonstrating their use as the anode photocatalyst in the half-cell reaction
  of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The GaOOH nanorods were further decorated
  with Au nanoparticles to endow them with increasingly pronounced charge separation,
  which conduced to a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance. Time-resolved
  photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed to depict the charge transfer event
  across the interface of GaOOH/Au, from which a correlation between photocatalytic
  efficiency and interfacial charge dynamics was realized. By incorporating GaOOH
  nanorods into the traditional Pt-catalyzed half-cell reaction, a 12.7% increase
  in anodic current generation can be attained under light illumination, demonstrating
  the promising potential of GaOOH as a practical anode photocatalyst in DFMCs. A
  further enhancement in methanol oxidation current up to 70.8% can be achieved by
  employing Au-decorated GaOOH nanorods, which was attributed to the efficient charge
  carrier transfer rendered by the Au decoration. The current study delivers both
  fundamental and practical importance as it broadens the scope of electrocatalysts
  for fuel cells, specifically by introducing a new class of highly efficient photocatalysts
  for promoting electrochemical reactions.
