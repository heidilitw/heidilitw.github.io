abstract: Vanadium oxides (VOx路nH2O) with long cycle-life for Li-ion supercapacitors
  have been successfully synthesized by means of the microwave-assisted hydrothermal
  synthesis (MAHS) method, a faster and more energy-saving method than the conventional
  hydrothermal synthesis. Such oxides show capacitor-like, lithium-ion intercalation/de-intercalation
  responses in aqueous media. Although electrochemical activation is required to reveal
  the capacitor-like behavior of VOx路nH2O, doping Li ions by adding LiCl into the
  precursor solution not only effectively shortens the activation time but also enhances
  the specific capacitance of VOx路nH2O. This kind of materials shows the promising
  application potential in the aqueous-based Li-ion supercapacitors. X-ray diffraction
  (XRD), Raman spectroscopic, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analyses
  are employed to identify the fine tune-up in microstructures of various VOx路nH2O.
