 abstract = {Vanadium oxides (VOx路nH2O) with long cycle-life for Li-ion
supercapacitors have been successfully synthesized by means of
the microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis (MAHS) method, a
faster and more energy-saving method than the conventional
hydrothermal synthesis. Such oxides show capacitor-like,
lithium-ion intercalation/de-intercalation responses in aqueous
media. Although electrochemical activation is required to reveal
the capacitor-like behavior of VOx路nH2O, doping Li ions by adding
LiCl into the precursor solution not only effectively shortens
the activation time but also enhances the specific capacitance of
VOx路nH2O. This kind of materials shows the promising application
potential in the aqueous-based Li-ion supercapacitors. X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopic, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopic (XPS) analyses are employed to identify the fine
tune-up in microstructures of various VOx路nH2O.},
