 abstract = {The most important factor that complicates the work of
dysmorphologists is the significant phenotypic variability of the
human face. Next-Generation Phenotyping (NGP) tools that assist
clinicians with recognizing characteristic syndromic patterns are
particularly challenged when confronted with patients from
populations different from their training data. To that end, we
systematically analyzed the impact of genetic ancestry on facial
dysmorphism. For that purpose, we established the GestaltMatcher
Database (GMDB) as a reference dataset for medical images of
patients with rare genetic disorders from around the world. We
collected 10,980 frontal facial images - more than a quarter
previously unpublished - from 8,346 patients, representing 581
rare disorders. Although the predominant ancestry is still
European (67%), data from underrepresented populations have been
increased considerably via global collaborations (19% Asian and
7% African). This includes previously unpublished reports for
more than 40% of the African patients. The NGP analysis on this
diverse dataset revealed characteristic performance differences
depending on the composition of training and test sets
corresponding to genetic relatedness. For clinical use of NGP,
incorporating non-European patients resulted in a profound
enhancement of GestaltMatcher performance. The top-5 accuracy
rate increased by +11.29%. Importantly, this improvement in
delineating the correct disorder from a facial portrait was
achieved without decreasing the performance on European patients.
By design, GMDB complies with the FAIR principles by rendering
the curated medical data findable, accessible, interoperable, and
reusable. This means GMDB can also serve as data for training and
benchmarking. In summary, our study on facial dysmorphism on a
global sample revealed a considerable cross ancestral phenotypic
variability confounding NGP that should be counteracted by
international efforts for increasing data diversity. GMDB will
serve as a vital reference database for clinicians and a
transparent training set for advancing NGP technology.},
