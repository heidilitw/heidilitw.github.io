abstract: For the first time a ZnO nanorod-based Z-scheme heterostructure system was
  proposed and realized for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. The samples
  were prepared by depositing a thin layer of SnO2 on the Au surface of Au particle-decorated
  ZnO nanorods. For ZnO-Au-SnO2 nanorods, the embedded Au can mediate interfacial
  charge transfer by promoting electron transfer from the conduction band of SnO2
  to the valence band of ZnO. This vectorial charge transfer resulted in the situation
  that the photoexcited electrons accumulated at ZnO while the photogenerated holes
  concentrated at SnO2, giving ZnO-Au-SnO2 substantially high redox powers. Time-resolved
  photoluminescence spectra suggested that the interfacial charge transfer across
  the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface was significantly improved as a result of the Z-scheme
  charge transfer mechanism. With the substantially high redox powers and significantly
  improved interfacial charge transfer, ZnO-Au-SnO2 nanorods performed much better
  as a photoanode in photoelectrochemical water splitting than pristine ZnO, plasmonic
  Au-decorated ZnO and type-II SnO2-coated ZnO nanorods did. The present study has
  provided a viable approach to exploit Z-scheme photoanodes in the design of efficient
  artificial photosynthesis systems for solar energy conversion.
