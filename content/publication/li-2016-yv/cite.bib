 abstract = {For the first time a ZnO nanorod-based Z-scheme heterostructure
system was proposed and realized for efficient
photoelectrochemical water splitting. The samples were prepared
by depositing a thin layer of SnO2 on the Au surface of Au
particle-decorated ZnO nanorods. For ZnO-Au-SnO2 nanorods, the
embedded Au can mediate interfacial charge transfer by promoting
electron transfer from the conduction band of SnO2 to the valence
band of ZnO. This vectorial charge transfer resulted in the
situation that the photoexcited electrons accumulated at ZnO
while the photogenerated holes concentrated at SnO2, giving
ZnO-Au-SnO2 substantially high redox powers. Time-resolved
photoluminescence spectra suggested that the interfacial charge
transfer across the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface was significantly
improved as a result of the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism.
With the substantially high redox powers and significantly
improved interfacial charge transfer, ZnO-Au-SnO2 nanorods
performed much better as a photoanode in photoelectrochemical
water splitting than pristine ZnO, plasmonic Au-decorated ZnO and
type-II SnO2-coated ZnO nanorods did. The present study has
provided a viable approach to exploit Z-scheme photoanodes in the
design of efficient artificial photosynthesis systems for solar
energy conversion.},
