## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. With a foundation in Chemical Engineering (B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D.), I transitioned into the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where I apply my technical expertise to develop innovative solutions for medical diagnostics. My research focuses on leveraging AI to analyze patients' frontal images, aiding in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders as part of the GestaltMatcher project. In addition to my research, I am the software engineer for the GestaltMatcher Database (https://db.gestaltmatcher.org), where I design and maintain the platform to support clinicians and researchers worldwide.
