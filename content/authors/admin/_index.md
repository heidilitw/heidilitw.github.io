      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Dr. Jing-Mei Li is currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. She received her bachelor’s, master’s, and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical Engineering.

She is currently working on next-generation phenotyping tools as part of the GestaltMatcher project and the GestaltMatcher Database. Her research focuses on analyzing patients with Alagille syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features and systemic abnormalities. By leveraging advanced AI-driven facial image analysis, Dr. Li aims to explore the potential of early diagnosis and newborn screening for Alagille syndrome. Her work highlights the transformative power of machine learning in clinical genetics and underscores the importance of integrating facial phenotyping into diagnostic workflows to improve outcomes for patients with rare disorders.
